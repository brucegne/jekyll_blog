## Before I was here.
First, I've been putting this off for what seems like forever now, But finally getting started on it.
Most of this will be my grandfathers side since that's the one I know the most about.
My grandfather was born in New York City or Germany. Don't have a reliable source for any of this, but his father Jacob was a violent alchoholic and ended up getting his mother and him shot at, almost striking his mother as they were running to escape. Because of this, his dad was deported back to Germany. I think his mother must have went with him because my great grandfather and his siblings ended up in a NYC orphanage. Three boys and two girls. 
Anyway, they ended up being shipped to Nebraska on what was known as the orphan trains where thousands of kids were sent to the midwest as kind of slave labor for farmers throughout the midwest. He was taken in by the Gordon family northwest of Sterling Nebraska. They never adapted him, but he loved them so much when he was older he has his last name legally changed to Gordon from Heinrich.
There were some stories that his mother and father made it back into the United States under the name 'Henry'. No clue, but I will try to do more research on that.  

He ended up marrying my grandmother Minnie Podtburg, having a son Charles Leroy, my father.
