# How I got here.

First, I've been putting this off for what seems like forever now, But finally getting started on it.  

Most of this will be my grandfather's side since that's the one I know the most about.
My grandfather was born in New York City or Germany. Don't have a reliable source for any of this, but his father Jacob was a violent alcoholic and ended up getting his mother and him shot at, almost striking his mother as they were running to escape. Because of this, his dad was deported back to Germany. I think his mother must have gone with him because my great grandfather and his siblings ended up in a NYC orphanage. Three boys and three girls.
Anyway, they ended up being shipped to Nebraska on what was known as the orphan trains where thousands of kids were sent to the midwest as kind of slave labor for farmers throughout the midwest. He was taken in by the Gordon family northwest of Sterling Nebraska. They never adopted him, but he loved them so much that when he was older he had his last name legally changed to Gordon from Heinrich.
There were some stories that his mother and father made it back into the United States under the name 'Henry'. No clue, but I will try to do more research on that. 

He married my grandmother Minnie Podtburg, having a son Charles Leroy, my father. Minnie died when my father was only 14. Don't really know any details of what happened to her, but my aunt told me that she fell down a set of stairs and she was pregnant at the time.

After my grandmothers death, he married her sister Bessie who I grew up knowing as my grandmother, even though my sister and I grew up calling her mom. So actually I was raised by my grandfather and great aunt.

My father went into the Army and served in the Korean conflict as a radio operator. As soon as he returned back home, he married the first woman who would marry him, Mildred Davison, my mother. Don't know anything about her and since I live in the same small town, I can't find anybody even in her age group or who I know to be her family admits to knowing her.

After having two children, myself and my older sister Laura, my parents split up when I was only 3 months old, at which time my sister and I went to live with our grandparents in Sterling Nebraska, which is where we grew up. More on that later.

My father was only around rarely, and I only met my mother once when I was in my early 20's, she died about 10 years later of some lung disease. My father passed away in a V.A. hospital when I was in my 30's from Parkinsons. My older sister died at the age of 62 from COPD.

Dispite a couple heart attacks and some kidney issues, I'm still here with 5 kids, 4 boys and a girl, and 10 grandkids.  

I still haven't and don't know if I ever will recover, the loss of my youngest son Michael Allen May 7, 2021 at the age of only 38. He left behind a wife Samantha and a 6 year old daughter Adalynn Kay and a 6 month old little boy of 6 months named Ezra Alan. He will always be loved and missed by so many people.

The next post will be about some of the interests and things I did growing up. Stay tuned....
