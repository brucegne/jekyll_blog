<h3>The early years</h3>

<p>I guess as far back as I can remember would be 1960-61 when I was like 4 or 5. Probably not going to really have much to say about that period because I was so young.
</p>
<p>I do remember going to kindergarten and running around and playing outside with sticks and dirt and other age appropriate things.
    We did have a good collection of neighborhood kids so it didn't take much to get a game of kick soccer in 
    the front yard. On the days when we had a lot of kids available, we might even go to the town 
    park and play on the baseball diamond. It was all of like a block and a half away.
